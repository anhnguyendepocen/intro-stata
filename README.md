# Material for an introductory Stata course

The files in this repository include data, slides etc. It is worth downloading everything as .zip into one folder, or cloning the repository, if you can.

The only files you will directly interact with are the **Intro-to-stata.pdf** slides, the **Stata cheat sheet.pdf** list of commands that we will encounter, and the .do files for each session, with names like **day-1-session-1...**. Everything else is accessed from inside those.

Contact me if you stumble upon this repository and would like a course along these lines. "It's what we do."
